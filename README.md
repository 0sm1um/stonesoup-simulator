# stonesoupsimulator
The purpose of this repository is to develop a set of tools for the purpose of running simulations for use in my papers I intend to publish.
The purpose is twofold: first is that my methods and results will be publicly available and viewable. Second is that I hope that the tools
I develop will grow more and more sophisticated as time goes on. It is my hope that one day these tools will be developed to the point
others may find them useful in their own work.
